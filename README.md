# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

## What This Project Does

- Loads stock data from Kaggle (`all_stocks_5yr.csv`)
- Prepares the data for time series analysis
- Trains an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Predicts future closing prices
- Plots the results

## Tools Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook `stock_predict_lstm.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset (`all_stocks_5yr.csv`)
3. Run each cell step by step
4. The model will show predicted vs actual prices

## Install Requirements

Use this if running locally:pip install -r requirements.txt
## Dataset

- **Name:** all_stocks_5yr.csv
- **Source:** Kaggle
- Contains stock data for multiple companies over 5 years
